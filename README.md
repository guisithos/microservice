Using Hyper crate to study a microservice. This examble responds with a "Rust tinyServer" page. 
The microservice has two paths - index page and not_found.

It is REST-compliant with basic CRUD operations - create, read, update and delete.

Routing is based on regular expressions who are patterns that check and extract data from txt.
